# [Gaming News Scrapper Live Demo](https://akinpinkman.github.io/gaming-news-scrapper/)

Gaming News Scrapper was made using **Cheerio, Axios, Express, and Nodemon**. It scrapes headlines, links, and feature images from Game Informer and GameSpot for new gaming news using Cheerio. Then it renders this fetched data to the front-end with **Express** in [Gaming News Scrapper](https://akinpinkman.github.io/gaming-news-scrapper/). 

 I created this project for my own development, without any profit motive, and to benefit me in my gaming articles.
